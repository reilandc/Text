# Text
I think that the text was fairly easy to use, however, I did have some problems with adjusting the size. 
Sometimes it wanted me to work only within the text tool box instead of on the layer, which I found confusing and would sometimes hinder me from highlight a word becasue I would be clicking on the actual layer and not the text within the toolbox,
I should've added more color to the text in my poster now that I am looking over it again. I will do that in my second draft.
I also found it odd that I had to search for the font in the toolbox instead of being given a list of options.
